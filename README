# ARCHOS Special Developer Edition #
####################################


This package contains:
- The overlay which should be added to the OpenEmbedded tree in order to build the Developer Edition kernel, initramfs and rootfs.
- A patch fixing some OpenEmbedded build issues, which has to be apply on top of the OpenEmbedded tree.


NOTES:
Please note that this overlay includes what is needed to build the Developer Edition for Generation 8 Archos devices, Archos5 IMT and Archos5 IT.
If you want to build the Archos5 IMT Developer Edition, you will have to edit "distro/angstrom-2008.1.conf" and uncomment "#KERNEL_CCSUFFIX_armv7a" (line 109) in order to build the 2.6.22 kernel successfully.
This Developer Edition is based on a checkout of OpenEmbedded "stable/2009" from December 2009.
